## 📱 Overview

**MarketplaceApp** is a fully functional, offline-capable shopping application built to demonstrate modern Android engineering standards. It consumes the [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com) to simulate a real-world environment.

Unlike typical demos, this app focuses on **"Delight"**—utilizing fluid Shared Element Transitions, Haptic Feedback, and the experimental Material 3 Expressive motion system to create a premium user feel.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🌊 Navigation 3 & Expressive UI
* **Shared Element Transitions**: Seamless `sharedBounds` animations transforming list items into detail screens.
* **Material 3 Expressive**: Utilizing the latest motion tokens for bouncier, more organic interactions.
* **Haptic Feedback**: Tactile responses for cart actions and navigation events.

### 2. 🏠 Robust Offline-First Strategy
* **Single Source of Truth**: The UI always observes the Room Database.
* **Smart Sync**: Repositories fetch from API, update DB, and UI reacts automatically.
* **Resilience**: Users can browse products, view details, and manage their cart seamlessly while in Airplane mode.

### 3. 🔐 Security & Auth
* **Encrypted Storage**: Auth tokens and passwords are encrypted and stored in Proto DataStore.
* **Validation**: Real-time input validation for Login/Register flows.

## 🏗 Architecture

The app is modularized by feature to ensure scalability and separation of concerns.
